\usage{
krscv(xz,
      y,
      degree.max = 10, 
      segments.max = 10,
      degree.min = 0,
      segments.min = 1, 
      restarts = 0,
      complexity = c("degree-knots","degree","knots"),
      knots = c("quantiles","uniform","auto"),
      basis = c("additive","tensor","glp","auto"),
      cv.func = c("cv.ls","cv.gcv","cv.aic"),

}

\arguments{

  \item{y}{
    continuous univariate vector
  }
  
  \item{xz}{ continuous and/or nominal/ordinal
    (\code{\link{factor}}/\code{\link{ordered}}) predictors }

  \item{degree.max}{ the maximum degree of the B-spline basis for
    each of the continuous predictors (default \code{degree.max=10})}
  
  \item{segments.max}{ the maximum segments of the B-spline basis for
    each of the continuous predictors (default \code{segments.max=10})}
  
  \item{degree.min}{ the minimum degree of the B-spline basis for
    each of the continuous predictors (default \code{degree.min=0})}
  
  \item{segments.min}{ the minimum segments of the B-spline basis for
    each of the continuous predictors (default \code{segments.min=1})}

  \item{restarts}{
    number of times to restart \code{\link{optim}} from different initial
    random values (default \code{restarts=0}) when searching for optimal
    bandwidths for the categorical predictors for each unique \code{K}
    combination (i.e.\ \code{degree}/\code{segments})
  }

  \item{complexity}{a character string (default
  \code{complexity="degree-knots"}) indicating whether model
  \sQuote{complexity} is determined by the degree of the spline or by
  the number of segments (\sQuote{knots}). This option allows the user
  to use cross-validation to select either the spline degree (number
  of knots held fixed) or the number of knots (spline degree held
  fixed) or both the spline degree and number of knots}

   \item{knots}{ a character string (default \code{knots="quantiles"})
  specifying where knots are to be placed. \sQuote{quantiles} specifies
  knots placed at equally spaced quantiles (equal number of observations
  lie in each segment) and \sQuote{uniform} specifies knots placed at
  equally spaced intervals. If \code{knots="auto"}, the knot type will
  be automatically determined by cross-validation }

  \item{basis}{ a character string (default \code{basis="additive"})
    indicating whether the additive or tensor product B-spline basis
    matrix for a multivariate polynomial spline or generalized B-spline
    polynomial basis should be used. Note this can be automatically
    determined by cross-validation if \code{cv=TRUE} and
    \code{basis="auto"}, and is an \sQuote{all or none} proposition
    (i.e. interaction terms for all predictors or for no predictors
    given the nature of \sQuote{tensor products}). Note also that if
    there is only one predictor this defaults to \code{basis="additive"}
    to avoid unnecessary computation as the spline bases are equivalent
    in this case }

  \item{cv.func}{a character string (default \code{cv.func="cv.ls"})
    indicating which method to use to select smoothing
    parameters. \code{cv.gcv} specifies generalized cross-validation
    (Craven and Wahba (1979)), \code{cv.aic} specifies expected
    Kullback-Leibler cross-validation (Hurvich, Simonoff, and Tsai
    (1998)), and \code{cv.ls} specifies least-squares
    cross-validation  }
  
  \item{degree}{ integer/vector specifying the degree of the B-spline
  basis for each dimension of the continuous \code{x}}
  
  \item{segments}{ integer/vector specifying the number of segments of
  the B-spline basis for each dimension of the continuous \code{x}
  (i.e. number of knots minus one)}

  \item{tau}{
    if non-null a number in (0,1) denoting the quantile for which a quantile
    regression spline is to be estimated rather than estimating the
    conditional mean (default \code{tau=NULL})
  }

  \item{weights}{ an optional vector of weights to be used in the
    fitting process.  Should be \sQuote{NULL} or a numeric vector.  If
    non-NULL, weighted least squares is used with weights
    \sQuote{weights} (that is, minimizing \sQuote{sum(w*e^2)});
    otherwise ordinary least squares is used.}

  \item{singular.ok}{
    a logical value (default \code{singular.ok=FALSE}) that, when
    \code{FALSE}, discards singular bases during cross-validation (a check
    for ill-conditioned bases is performed).
  }

}

\details{

  \code{krscv} computes exhaustive cross-validation for a regression
  spline estimate of a one (1) dimensional dependent variable on an
  \code{r}-dimensional vector of continuous and nominal/ordinal
  (\code{\link{factor}}/\code{\link{ordered}}) predictors. The optimal
  \code{K}/\code{lambda} combination is returned along with other
  results (see below for return values). The method uses kernel
  functions appropriate for categorical (ordinal/nominal) predictors
  which avoids the loss in efficiency associated with sample-splitting
  procedures that are typically used when faced with a mix of continuous
  and nominal/ordinal (\code{\link{factor}}/\code{\link{ordered}})
  predictors.

  For the continuous predictors the regression spline model employs
  either the additive or tensor product B-spline basis matrix for a
  multivariate polynomial spline via the B-spline routines in the GNU
  Scientific Library (\url{https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/}) and the
  \code{\link{tensor.prod.model.matrix}} function.

  For the discrete predictors the product kernel function is of the
  \sQuote{Li-Racine} type (see Li and Racine (2007) for details).
  
  For each unique combination of \code{degree} and \code{segment},
  numerical search for the bandwidth vector \code{lambda} is undertaken
  using \code{\link{optim}} and the box-constrained \code{L-BFGS-B}
  method (see \code{\link{optim}} for details). The user may restart the
  \code{\link{optim}} algorithm as many times as desired via the
  \code{restarts} argument. The approach ascends from \code{K=0} through
  \code{degree.max}/\code{segments.max} and for each value of \code{K}
  searches for the optimal bandwidths for this value of \code{K}. After
  the most complex model has been searched then the optimal
  \code{K}/\code{lambda} combination is selected. If any element of the
  optimal \code{K} vector coincides with
  \code{degree.max}/\code{segments.max} a warning is produced and the
  user ought to restart their search with a larger value of
  \code{degree.max}/\code{segments.max}.

}

\value{

  \code{krscv} returns a \code{crscv} object. Furthermore, the
    function \code{\link{summary}} supports objects of this type. The
    returned objects have the following components:

  \item{K}{ scalar/vector containing optimal degree(s) of spline or
  number of segments }
  \item{K.mat}{ vector/matrix of values of \code{K} evaluated during search }  
  \item{restarts}{ number of restarts during search, if any }
  \item{lambda}{ optimal bandwidths for categorical predictors }
  \item{lambda.mat}{ vector/matrix of optimal bandwidths for each degree of spline }
  \item{cv.func}{ objective function value at optimum }
  \item{cv.func.vec}{ vector of objective function values at each degree
  of spline or number of segments in \code{K.mat}}
