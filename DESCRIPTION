Description: Regression splines that handle a mix of continuous and categorical (discrete) data often encountered in applied settings. I would like to gratefully acknowledge support from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC, <https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca>), the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC, <https://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca>), and the Shared Hierarchical Academic Research Computing Network (SHARCNET, <https://www.sharcnet.ca>). We would also like to acknowledge the contributions of the GNU GSL authors. In particular, we adapt the GNU GSL B-spline routine gsl_bspline.c adding automated support for quantile knots (in addition to uniform knots), providing missing functionality for derivatives, and for extending the splines beyond their endpoints.
